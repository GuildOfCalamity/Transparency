* Demonstration of transparent [WinUI3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3) [Window](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.window?view=windows-app-sdk-1.5) widget.
* This feature is trivial when using the [AllowsTransparency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.window.allowstransparency?view=windowsdesktop-8.0#remarks) property in WPF; but since the WinUI3 Window is meant for x-plat purposes we do not have that luxury.
